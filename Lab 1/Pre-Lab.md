<b>6.1.1:</b> What is the total resistance of two resistors in parallel that each have a resistance <b>R</b>?

The total resistance of two resistors in parallel <b>R<sub>eff</b>, each with a resistance of <b>R</b>, is equal to $\frac{2}{R}$.

$$R_{eff} = \frac{2}{R}$$

<b>6.1.2:</b> Find the total resistance of the combination of resistors shown below.

The 75 $\mathrm{\Omega}$ resistor is in parallel with the 100 $\mathrm{\Omega}$ resistor so

$$\frac{1}{R_{eff,100,75}} = \frac{1}{75} + \frac{1}{100}$$

so, 

$$R_{eff,100,75} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{75} + \frac{1}{100}} = 42.9\mathrm{\Omega}$$

The 50 $\mathrm{\Omega}$ resistor is now in series with <b>R<sub>eff</b> of the other two resistors, so the respective resistances add as

$$R_{T} = 42.9 + 50 = 92.9\mathrm{\Omega}$$

<b>6.3.1:</b> Calculate the total capacitance of the combination of capacitors shown below.
